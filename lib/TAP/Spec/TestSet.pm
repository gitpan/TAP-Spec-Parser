=head1 NAME

TAP::Spec::TestSet - A set of related TAP tests

=head1 VERSION

version 0.07

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 body

B<Required>: The testset body (contains the test results, as well as any
bail-outs, and any comment lines outside of the headers). Is a 
L<TAP::Spec::Body>.

=head2 plan

B<Required>: The test plan. Is a L<TAP::Spec::Plan>.

=head2 version

B<Computed>: The TAP spec version. If a version is present in the header,
it is used, otherwise version 12 is assumed.

=head2 header

B<Required>: The TAP header. Is a L<TAP::Spec::Header>.

=head2 footer

B<Required>: The TAP footer. Is a L<TAP::Spec::Footer>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $testset->as_tap

TAP representation.

=head2 $testset->passed

Whether the testset is considered to have passed. A testset passes if a plan
was found, and the number of tests executed matches the number of tests planned,
and all tests are passing.
